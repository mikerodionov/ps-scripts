## On Windows Server 2019 and with 5.3 K2 Configuration service fails to start (clean install)

Start in console mode, and verify which error you are getting. You can possible receive something like that:

```
It was not possible to find any compatible framework version
The specified framework 'Microsoft.NETCore.App', version '2.1.11' was not found.
  - Check application dependencies and target a framework version installed at:
      C:\Program Files\K2\SourceCode.Configuration.Api\
  - Installing .NET Core prerequisites might help resolve this problem:
      https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=798306&clcid=0x409
  - The .NET Core framework and SDK can be installed from:
      https://aka.ms/dotnet-download
  - The following versions are installed:
      2.1.7 at [C:\Program Files\dotnet\shared\Microsoft.NETCore.App]
      6.0.2 at [C:\Program Files\dotnet\shared\Microsoft.NETCore.App]
```

You will need to install required version of ASP.NET Core Runtime - https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/2.1

Solution: force packages reinstall as desctibed in [K2 5.3 Force packages reinstallation](##-K2-5.x-Force-packages-reinstallation)

## K2 5.x Force packages reinstallation

1. Browse to: C:\Program Files (x86)\K2\Setup
*  Delete all the files that end on .kspx 

2. Browse to: C:\Program Files (x86)\K2\Bin\ControlPack Controls
* Delete all the files except â€œTelerik.Web.UI.dll

3. Execute this script against the K2 DB after taking a full K2 database backup:

```SQL
DELETE FROM [K2].[Hostserver].[HostserverSetting]
WHERE [Name] LIKE '%.kspx%' 
OR [Name] LIKE 'Register_Control_%'
GO
```

4. Run installer with CONFIGURE option

5. Reinstall the current K2 Cumulative Update and FixPack on the environment

## K2 5.3 CU installation declines to proceed - installed version not recognized

PROBLEM: You have 5.3 installet yet 5.3 CU declines to install, with the following error:

![image](/K2/Images/K253CUDoesNotSupportUpdatingYourVersion.png)

K2 Five (5.3) Cumulative Update does not support updating your version

SOLUTION:
* With FP installer window open you can use Ctrt + Shift + F8 to open trace file
* In trace file you will be able to see supported/expected K2 versions for CU (InstallChekcer.IsProductIntalledfromNamePart)
* In case of 5.3 April 2020 CU you may see that expected full version/build is "5.0004.1000.1" for K2 5.3 RTM, which does not match updated installer build you are using (.3 most likely) - that can be corrected by editing build number in Registry - see details below - adjust build digit as required (changing 3 to 1).
```PowerShell
# HKCL\K2_COMPONENT_GUID\Product Name
# K2 Package and Deployment
Get-ItemPropertyValue -Path Registry::HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\Installer\Products\5CA5B2507AE700006419DDDDDDDDDD3D\ -Name ProductName
# K2 Server
Get-ItemPropertyValue -Path Registry::HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\Installer\Products\5CA5B2507AE740906419B46010707EE8\ -Name ProductName
# K2 Site
Get-ItemPropertyValue -Path Registry::HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\Installer\Products\5CA5B2507AE740906419B46010907675\ -Name ProductName

# K2 Server
Get-ItemPropertyValue -Path Registry::HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\Installer\Products\5CA5B2507AE740906419B46010707EE8\ -Name ProductName
```
* 5.3 November 2020 CU expects you to be on April 2020 CU first or have your build as 5.0004.1000.X - adust build in the registry to install it directly on top of 5.3 RTM.

## K2 Pass-Through Authentication settings

K2 Pass-Through Authentication is installed with K2 for all installations in a distributed environment. If a simple/full installation is chosen, K2PTA is not needed and you will not see the User Configuration page.

The manner in which K2 Pass-Through Authentication works can be configured using the DelegationContext node in the AppSettings section of the K2HostServer.exe.Config file found in the "%PROGRAMFILES%\K2\HostServer\Bin\" folder. The two options for this setting are ClientKerberos and ClientWindows. This setting is global for all server connections regardless of the source. If a network load balancer (NLB) is in place, all K2 server nodes should have the same setting to prevent inconsistent behavior.

```
<!-- Possible options -->
<add key="DelegationContext" value="ClientKerberos" />
<add key="DelegationContext" value="ClientWindows" />

```

###ClientKerberos

ClientKerberos is the default setting and the system will assume as much if no change is made. With this option set, the K2 server performs normal delegation using NTLM and assumes that Kerberos has been configured.

If Kerberos was not configured, error messages are logged in the K2 Server Log. When a connection is made that requests K2 Pass-Through Authentication, and delegation fails, an error message is logged to help identify the problem. When Kerberos Delegation or NTLM authentication takes place, the assumption is that the system is working as expected and no error messages are recorded.

ClientKerberos is the recommended option for enabling maximum security, which implies that the system administrator has decided not to use K2 Pass-Through Authentication. This is the recommended option due to the benefits of using Kerberos, such as better control of delegation and the passing of authentication requests. However, Kerberos introduces the requirement for good planning and a higher degree of expertise to install. Resources are available from the K2 Customer Portal to assist in configuring Kerberos, and it is strongly recommended that these be used.

### ClientWindows

ClientWindows constrains K2 Pass-Through Authentication to only occur if the client credentials are of WindowsIdentity type (a valid Windows token). This implementation prevents less secure user clients such as Forms and Claims identities from passing credentials. If Kerberos (or NTLM) is working, it uses those credentials. This is the recommended option for environments containing only Windows users and who need to maximize functionality and security, and this does not require Kerberos to be configured.
